## Installation

1. Copy the .dll and .exe files to your Fallout NV directory. For Steam this is usually in your Program Files folder under *Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Fallout New Vegas\\*. If you see files named FalloutNV.exe and FalloutNVLauncher.exe, this is the correct folder. **Do not copy these files to the Data folder or install it with MO2 as with a normal mod.**

2. Launch NV via running *nvse_loader.exe* or, if you have patched the game using [FNV 4GB Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552/), *FalloutNV.exe*. Enabling the Steam Community option (enabled by default) will allow you to launch the game via Steam's standard UI.

xNVSE is compatible with the Steam and GOG versions of the game. German No Gore, Xbox Gamepass, and Bethesda.net versions are not supported. Epic Games Store users can use the [Epic Games Patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/81281).

If you experience a crash related to installing xNVSE, please try disabling all other mods to see if xNVSE is the culprit. If the problem persists, please include a crash log generated by a [Crash Logger](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/82540) inside your bug report.

## Description

**New Vegas Script Extender** (NVSE) is a modder's resource that expands the scripting capabilities of Fallout: New Vegas. It does so without modifying the executable files on disk, so there are no permanent side effects.
